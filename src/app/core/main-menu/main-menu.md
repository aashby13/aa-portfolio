# Main Menu Component

### HACK!:
* Safari calculates offsetLeft differently than Chrome & Firefox
* Had to detect Safari with navigator.vendor to adjust for dif result in animating x of line


### TODO:
* Check if issue exists or not on Edge
* Find a better way that doesn't involve detect browser hack
